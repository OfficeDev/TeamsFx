# How to create a free Teams developer tenant via ITP?

`ITP(Instant Tenant Procurement)` is to get you an instant sandbox of Microsoft 365 developer environment. Instead of making you provison all your Microsoft 365 apps and install your data packs one by one, it contains pre-installed sample data packs so you can quickly work on this tenant. E.g. The Teams App `sideloading permission` is pre-configured and you don' have to turn on the sideloading and wait for up to 24 hours util it takes effect.
