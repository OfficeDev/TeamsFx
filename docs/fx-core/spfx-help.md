# SPFx troubleshoot

## Overview

For SPFx app, Teams Toolkit uses Yeoman Generator for scaffolding. This requires both [Yeoman CLI](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) and the correct SPFx generator version to be installed.

## Prerequisites installation

As the default behavior, Teams Toolkit will try to install them locally under `HOME/.fx`. Should the installation fail, we would revert to use your globally installed ones.

### Step 1: Disable Prerequisite Checker

Go to _Manage > Settings > Extension > Teams Toolkit > SPFx Prerequisite Check_ or run 'Preferences: Open User Settings'.

And uncheck these 2:

- Ensure Yeoman CLI is installed
- Ensure SPFx generator is installed

### Step 2: Manually install or upgrade

In the output message in VSC, you should see the versions for Yeoman CLI and SPFx generator that Teams Toolkit supports. In this example output message, you can see that they are `4.3.0` and `1.14.0`:

In the following, navigate to **your applicable scenario**:

#### If you have Yeoman CLI and SPFx generator installed with the correct versions

Teams Toolkit will use them for scaffolding, there's no further action that needs to be taken now. You can now retry creating a new SPFx Teams app.

#### If no Yeoman CLI is installed in your system

1. Run this any place in a terminal:

```sh
npm install --global yo
```

2. Install the SPFx generator version that Teams Toolkit supports, say `1.14`:

```sh
npm install @microsoft/generator-sharepoint@1.14 -g
```

#### If you have Yeoman CLI installed but it's not the correct version

Install the Yeoman CLI version that Teams Toolkit supports, say `4.3.0`:

```sh
npm install --global yo@4.3.0
```

#### If you have Yeoman CLI installed but no SPFx generator

Install the SPFx generator version that Teams Toolkit supports, say `1.14`:

```sh
npm install @microsoft/generator-sharepoint@1.14 -g
```

#### If you have SPFx generator installed but it's not the correct version

1. If the global version is higher than the supported version

You can continue with your currently installed version but please note that some of the latest features might not be supported in Teams Toolkit.

2. If the global version is lower than supported
Install the SPFx generator version that Teams Toolkit supports, say `1.14`:

```sh
npm install @microsoft/generator-sharepoint@1.14 -g
```

## Yeoman scaffold

By default,  locally installed `yo` is engaged to execute the following command with related _args_:

```sh
yo @microsoft/sharepoint 
```

SPFx scaffolding could fail due to unsuccessful execution of above command.

#### _"Failed to run command: " yo @microsoft/sharepoint ..." , 'yo' is not recognized as an internal or external command"_

If your OS system is Windows,

1. Check your npm and Node.js version. [Supported Node.js versions for SPFx v1.14.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment#install-nodejs) are:

- Node.js v12.13.0+ (_Erbium_)
- Node.js v14.15.0+ (_Fermium_)
Corresponding npm version is v6.x. Please make sure you have the right version installed for both npm and Node.js.

2. Check executable files for `yo` exist after package installation at the correct path under _HOME\\.fx\bin\spfx_

If your OS system is MacOS or Linux,

1. Check executable files for `yo` exist after package installation at the correct path under _HOME\\.fx\bin\spfx\node_modules\\.bin_
