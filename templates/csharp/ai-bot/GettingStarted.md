# Welcome to Teams Toolkit!

This template showcases a bot app that responds to user questions like an AI assistant. This enables your users to talk with the AI assistant in Teams to find information.

The app template is built using the Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based Teams applications.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**
> To run the AI Chat Bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource or an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).

1. Set your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/api/) to *appsettings.Development.json*.

    ```json
      "OpenAI": {
        "ApiKey": "<your-openai-api-key>"
      },
    ```
1. In the debug dropdown menu, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel
1. Right-click your project and select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies
1. If prompted, sign in with a Microsoft 365 account for the Teams organization you want 
to install the app to
1. Press F5, or select the Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio
1. In the launched browser, select the Add button to load the app in Teams
1. In the chat bar, type and send anything to your bot to trigger a response

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Teams:

### Deploy to Azure

Note that, this sample requires AI service so you need one more pre-step before deploy to Azure. To configure the Azure resources to have an environment variable for the OpenAI Key:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/api/) to the environment variable `SECRET_OPENAI_KEY=`.

The `SECRET_` prefix is a convention used by Teams Toolkit to mask the value in any logging output and is optional.

### Use Azure OpenAI

Above steps use OpenAI as AI service, optionally, you can also use Azure OpenAI as AI service.

**As prerequisites**
> - Prepare your own [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource.

1. Prepare your own Azure OpenAI service and Azure AI Content Safety service.
1. Modify source code `Program.cs`, comment out the "*#Use OpenAI*" part, and uncomment the "*#Use Azure OpenAI and Azure Content Safety*" part.

1. Set your Azure OpenAI related settings to *appsettings.Development.json*.

    ```json
      "Azure": {
        "OpenAIApiKey": "<your-azure-openai-api-key>",
        "OpenAIEndpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"
      }
    ```

**For deployment to Azure**

To configure the Azure resources to have Azure OpenAI environment variables:

1. In `./env/.env.dev.user` file, paste your Azure OpenAI related variables.

    ```bash
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    ```
