> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

A command bot for receiving commands and sending responses in Teams.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class CommandBot 
```

## Remarks

Ensure each command should ONLY be registered with the command once, otherwise it'll cause unexpected behavior if you regiter the same command more than once.

## Example

You can register your commands through the constructor of the [CommandBot](./teamsfx.commandbot.md)<!-- -->, or use the `registerCommand` and `registerCommands` API to add commands after creating the `CommandBot` instance.

```typescript
// register through constructor
const commandBot = new CommandBot(adapter, [ new HelloWorldCommandHandler() ]);

// register through `register*` API
commandBot.registerCommand(new HelpCommandHandler());
```
