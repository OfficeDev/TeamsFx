## Frequently asked questions

### What does pre-release mean

Pre-release is meant for those eager to try the latest Teams Toolkit features and fixes. Even though pre-releases are not intended for use in production, they are at a sufficient quality level for you to generally use and [provide feedback](https://aka.ms/ttk-feedback). However, pre-release versions can and probably will change, and those changes could be significant.

### What about my existing Teams Toolkit projects

The changes in this pre-release require upgrades to the TeamsFx configuration files. You can migrate by creating a new project and move your exiting code, or Teams Toolkit have also provided a way to automatically upgrade existing Teams apps that were created with a previous version of Teams Toolkit.
