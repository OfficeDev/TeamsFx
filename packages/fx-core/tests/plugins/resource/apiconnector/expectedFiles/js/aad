Your next steps:
1. Run npm install. If your project did not install @microsoft/teamsfx package before, we have added it to package.json for you.
   You need to run the command under "bot" folder instead of project's root folder.
2. Replace "<your-api-scope>" in this file with actual scope required by the API.
3. Gain consent of the required scope.
4. Add the scope to "templates/appPackage/aad.template.json" in this project.
   You can visit https://aka.ms/teamsfx-aad-manifest to learn more about the AAD app template.

You can now import the API client (an Axios instance) in another file and call fake APIs without worrying about authentication.
Here is an example for a GET request to "relative_path_of_target_api":
const result = await fakeClient.get("relative_path_of_target_api");

You can refer https://aka.ms/teamsfx-connect-api to learn more.

const teamsfxSdk = require("@microsoft/teamsfx");

// Loads current app's configuration, the sample uses client credential flow to acquire token for your API.
const teamsFx = new teamsfxSdk.TeamsFx(teamsfxSdk.IdentityType.App);
// Initializes a new axios instance to call fake API.
const appCredential = teamsFx.getCredential();
const authProvider = new teamsfxSdk.BearerTokenAuthProvider(
  // Please replace '<your-api-scope>' with actual api scope value.
  async () => (await appCredential.getToken("<your-api-scope>")).token

const fakeClient = teamsfxSdk.createApiClient(
  teamsFx.getConfig("TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_ENDPOINT"),
  authProvider
