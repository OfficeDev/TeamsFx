## How to reuse existing bot registration in Toolkit v2?

Suppose an existing bot has been registered by [azure bot channel registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) or [bot framework's legacy portal](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new), you can follow this guide to reuse the existing bot registration in Toolkit v2.

No matter registering bot by azure bot channel registration or bot framework's legacy portal, a pair of bot id and bot password will be generated. please copy/paste them after choosing reusing existing bot in Toolkit v2.

### Pay attention!!!
