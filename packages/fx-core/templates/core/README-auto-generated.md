## Take a tour of your app source code

After initializing the project, you can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code after the Teams Toolkit registers and configures your app. The following table lists all the scaffolded folder and files by Teams Toolkit:

|- | -|
|`.fx/configs/config.local.json`| Configuration file for local environment |
