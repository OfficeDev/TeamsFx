/*
Your next steps:
1. Run npm install. If your project did not install @microsoft/teamsfx package before, we have added it to package.json for you.
   You need to run the command under "bot" folder instead of project's root folder.
2. Add your API Key to TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_APIKEY in "bot/.env.teamsfx.local".

You can now import the API client (an Axios instance) in another file and call fake APIs without worrying about authentication.
Here is an example for a GET request to "relative_path_of_target_api":
const result = await fakeClient.get("relative_path_of_target_api");

const teamsfxSdk = require("@microsoft/teamsfx");

// Loads current app's configuration.
const teamsFx = new teamsfxSdk.TeamsFx();
// Initializes a new axios instance to call fake API.
const authProvider = new teamsfxSdk.ApiKeyProvider(
  "fake_api_key_name",
  teamsFx.getConfig("TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_API_KEY"),
  teamsfxSdk.ApiKeyLocation.Header
);
const fakeClient = teamsfxSdk.createApiClient(
  teamsFx.getConfig("TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_ENDPOINT"),
  authProvider
);
module.exports.fakeClient = fakeClient;
